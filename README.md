# DraganDrop
The purpose of this small project is to provide a solution for transferring data between machines without the need for long-term storage. 
Users can upload their data to this application, which serves as a temporary intermediary.
The uploaded data can then be accessed from another machine, allowing for easy transfer without the need for external storage devices or network connections between the machines.

To ensure the privacy and security of the data,
The application is designed to automatically delete the uploaded files after a set period of time,
In this case, the data is removed from the application's storage after 10 minutes, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or unintended data exposure.
